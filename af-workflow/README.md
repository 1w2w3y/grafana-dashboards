# Agent Framework - Workflow Overview

![Agent Framework Workflow Dashboard](https://github.com/1w2w3y/grafana-dashboards/raw/master/af-workflow/af-workflow.gif)

Comprehensive monitoring dashboard for **Microsoft Agent Framework Workflows**, tracking workflow executions, executor performance, visual workflow graphs, and detailed trace analysis. Monitor your multi-agent workflows' health, execution paths, success rates, and identify bottlenecks in real-time.

## üîÑ What are Agent Framework Workflows?

[Microsoft Agent Framework Workflows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/agent-framework/overview/agent-framework-overview#workflows) provide a structured way to orchestrate complex, multi-step processes involving multiple AI agents, functions, and external systems. Unlike single AI agents that work autonomously, workflows give you explicit control over execution paths through a graph-based architecture.

Workflows are designed to handle tasks that are too complex for a single agent, offering:
- **Modularity**: Break down processes into reusable components
- **Agent Integration**: Orchestrate multiple AI agents with non-agentic functions
- **Type Safety**: Strong typing ensures correct message flow between components
- **Flexible Flow**: Graph-based executors with conditional routing and parallel processing
- **Checkpointing**: Save and resume long-running processes
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Built-in request/response patterns for external integration

## üéØ Why This Dashboard?

When building multi-agent workflows that coordinate multiple AI agents and functions, you need visibility into:

- **Execution Health**: Are your workflows completing successfully?
- **Performance**: Where are the bottlenecks in your execution graph?
- **Executor Behavior**: Which executors are taking the longest? Which ones fail most often?
- **Workflow Structure**: How are your executors connected? What's the execution flow?
- **Debugging**: What happened in failed workflow runs?

This dashboard answers all these questions and more‚Äîwith interactive visualizations and real-time metrics.
