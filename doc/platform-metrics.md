# Grafana dashboards for AI Foundry platform metrics

AI Foundry model deployments will automatically emit useful Azure Monitor metrics. **No configuration is required**.  You can leverage this AI Foundry Grafana dashboard to view cost, usage and performance of your model deployments. The dashboard is available directly within the Azure portal, with no extra setup or costs. 

## Prerequisites
To use monitoring dashboard for model deployments in Foundry Models, you need the following:
- An Azure AI services resource. For more information, see [Create an Azure AI Services resource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/foundry-models/how-to/quickstart-create-resources?pivots=ai-foundry-portal).
- At least one model deployment.
- Access to diagnostic information for the resource.
